### Level 0
 - Bug and issue lists are managed by each developer
 - Users need to describe in excruciating detail the steps they took to cause the bug
 - It is common for issues to be closed with a statuses of 'Works for me' and 'Not a bug'
 - The users have developed a 'workaround' list

### Level 1
 - Bug and issue tracking are managed and shared amongst the development team, which provides analytics such as number of open bugs and long-lived bugs
 - The system is able to self-monitor and can detect many different types of configuration, instability and outage scenarios

### Level 2
 - Users use the bug/issue/feature system to request modifications to the system, which are voted on and prioritised by the user community
 - The system provides anonymised information about how the users actually use the system, allowing the developers to see if features are used as expected, and what optimisations can be made for a better user experience
 - The system is able to identify when bugs occur, and automatically raise support tickets, alleviating the user from needing to describe what they were doing when the issue occurred
