title: '3.2. Reporting back findings'
---

At the end of discovery, you should report back on your findings in a discovery document. This can be shared with senior stakeholders and across government.

Your discovery document should include:

- an overview of the approach you took and who you engaged with
- [the artefacts you've produced]({{ site.baseurl }}/2-starting-discovery/2-5-artefacts.html), including a service map
- the major findings that emerged from user research and the technology discovery
- recommendations and hypotheses you're going to test at alpha
