Your whole team should [understand the tools and systems](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/4-tools-and-systems/ "read about criterion 4 of the Digital Service Standard") that will be used for your service.

# Development environment

During Beta, it is important that you&rsquo;re able to quickly adapt to user needs by releasing working code early. Your ability to do this is heavily impacted by the tools and environments you use, so it&rsquo;s important to take some time to get everything configured in a way that suits your team. Ideally you should expand on the environment youâ€™ve developed during Alpha.

Where possible, we recommend that you use cloud hosted tools for your development environment, which helps to get the team up and running quickly whilst minimising ongoing project costs.

At a minimum, you should aim to use cloud tools for the following (I should probably explain what these do, and why you want them):

*	Version control
*	Continuous integration
*	Continuous deployment or delivery

The DTO offers cloud hosting, including maintenance, for free for the life of the service while it&rsquo;s hosted with the DTO.

# Using open standards

Something about how using open standards allows others to use what you&rsquo;ve made, and offer even more value to your users.

Also something about preventing proprietary lock in by vendors, and the ability to expand and adopt new inclusions over time.

# Be prepared to change

If your service is built using open source components that are frequently updated, you should plan on keeping them current. You don&rsquo;t have to stay up to date with the bleeding edge changes, but ensure you have a plan to adopt any critical updates, such as those impacting security or accessibility.
