You need to be sure your service is ready for public use. So ensure you have addressed the following before you launch the service.

*	Have you passed all criteria in the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/ "visit the Digital Service Standard page")?
	-	If not, have a plan to address the criteria that need attention.

# Communications plan

Ensure any communications going out to stakeholders and the public are ready to go when needed.

# Migration

*	If the service is running in a Development environment, make sure the migration to Production can happen in a timely fashion and that you have any necessary approvals to do so.
*	If you intend to migrate from the DTO back to your agency, have that planned with technical resources ready.
*	Have your developers and web ops team ready to fix any technical problems that may arise during or immediately after the launch.

# Continuous improvement

*	Do you have a full team ready to continue the work?
*	Youâ€™ll be small releasing changes frequently, so if you have a change advisory board to traverse, engage them early to enable your release strategy.
