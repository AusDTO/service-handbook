title: "5.3. Finishing Beta"
section: 5-measuring-success
---

Some key things to consider about finishing and being successful for Beta are:

*	Does the service satisfy the scope of your Minimum Viable Product?
*	Does the project rate Green when assessed against the Digital Service Standard?
*	What is the plan to maintain and continue improvement of the service / product?
	-	A business owner (product and service manager) should be available, hands-on, transparent and participative.
*	Who will be on the team after Beta?
*	Will the team return to a physical environment conducive to co-locating a multidisciplinary team?

# Being open
By the time you go live you should be able to show:

*	how you are making new source code open and reusable, for example, storing in repositories, releasing code under licence, using APIs
*	you have provided a plan or guidance for contributors
*	how you&rsquo;re handling updates and bug fixes to the code.

# Where will the service be hosted?

If you&rsquo;re hosting the service in the DTO environment, you will also need a plan to transition the service back to the parent agency if required. This is not mandatory, there may be valid reasons to leave the service hosted in the DTO environment.
User testing
Throughout Beta, you&rsquo;ll be doing user research and testing. The research helps make sure you&rsquo;re still building the right thing - is it solving the user need?

You should also have an **automated testin**g process in place by the time you take the thing on the road to test with real users.

Beyond Beta, you need to plan to continue engaging users to test the thing as you iterate on the MVP and ultimately the live service.
