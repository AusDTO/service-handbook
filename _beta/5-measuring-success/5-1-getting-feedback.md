# Getting feedback

As you&rsquo;re building the thing, it&rsquo;s important to be able to demonstrate the value of the service you&rsquo;re delivering. Think about what metrics you might use to compare the current state to that which you will deliver with the new service. You want to be able to measure your success and user satisfaction.

Consider not only value to the user, but savings to government that will be realised by your service. Measuring benefits and value will help you to articulate the overall success of your service.

You&rsquo;ll have tracked your costs from the start of Discovery stage and commenced articulating the expected benefits to be provided by your service. Now is the time to report on those benefits.  Using the baseline data you have collected through the Discovery and Alpha stages you should be able to value map your service, its time and cost savings and its benefits for the user cohorts you've identified. 

You might consider collecting metrics that allow you to measure and cost the time it takes for your users to complete the process before and after your redesign, if you are replacing an existing service. 

You&rsquo;ll develop a benefits roadmap or value stream of what benefits might be realised and when. You will need to report this high level benefits your service provides as part of your Beta assessment.

## HEART Framework

Developed by Google&rsquo;s research team, the [HEART framework](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36299.html "read about the HEART framework") provides a series of user-centred metrics to measure user experience on a large scale, as well as a process for mapping product goals to metrics. You can then use these metrics as part of your decision making during the service development.

There are five metrics used in the HEART framework:

*	**Happiness** - a measure of attitude or satisfaction.
*	**Engagement** - how much a user interacts with the service, of their own volition.
*	**Adoption** - defined as the number of new users over a certain time frame. Use with care, since sales and marketing efforts may impact this metric.
*	**Retention** - keeping your existing users for x amount of time.
*	**Task Success** - this can be broken down into time spent on any given task (can it be improved?) or the percentage of successful completions of a given task once it has begun. (e.g., registration process). Remote usability testing and benchmarking studies are recommended for measuring these on a large scale.

Your project may not require all the metrics. Choose the metrics, potentially in combination, based on the outcome required from the metrics.

For example, measuring Engagement may be of little value if your users have no choice in using the service in their organisation.
