To support teams, the [Standard criteria pages](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/ "visit the Digital Servie Standard criteria pages") set out how you&rsquo;ll be assessed during the beta stage. Teams should maintain their own Standards tracking kanban to make sure they are in a good position to demonstrate how the service meets the Standard at the Beta stage. 

Your assessment team will continue with their inflight check-ins each week and support you through the Beta stage. 

After private Beta has been conducted and [in-flight check-ins](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/meeting-standard/ "read about meeting the Digital Service Standard") show green against all criteria, a retrospective style review of the team&rsquo;s progress should be held with the assessors. 

Assessors should confirm, in collaboration with the team that the stage is complete. The assessors will draft up a short report, using outcomes and information from the weekly check ins,  addressing the progress against all relevant criteria. The report should highlight areas of good performance, areas where further work needs to done, and what the nature of that work is. 

The Beta stage assessment report requires additional evidentiary information, for example: 

*	Links to code repositories 
*	Links to the Performance Dashboard where the team is reporting against their KPI&rsquo;s
*	Any benefits that might already be realised 
 
That report will then be submitted to the Standard team for publication on the DTO&rsquo;s [Assessment reports page](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/assessments/ "visit the Assessment reports page on the DTO website") and the DTO Dashboard.
