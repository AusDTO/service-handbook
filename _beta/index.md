This guide is intended to help teams going through the Beta stage of [the service delivery process](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/service-design-and-delivery-process/). It describes the DTO's recommended approach to Beta, drawing on our experiences from working with projects in the [Digital Transformation Programme](https://www.dto.gov.au/projects/).

The guide is part of the [Service Handbook]({{ site.baseurl }}), a growing collection of content about building good digital services.

We welcome any feedback and suggestions from your own experiences. To make a suggestion, please raise an issue or submit a pull request on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ausdto/service-handbook).

We suggest starting at [the introduction]({{ site.baseurl }}/alpha/1-introduction/1-1-what.html).
