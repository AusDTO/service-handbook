title: "1.1. What is Beta?"
section: 1-introduction
---

Beta is where you apply what you’ve learned by iteratively developing and showing your prototypes from Alpha, helping you select the best approach to turn your MVP into a working service.

It’s the third stage of DTO’s [service design and delivery process](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/service-design-and-delivery-process/), where you build a fully working service for real users. It will be continuously released into your development environment, and potentially integrated with existing components and services that were identified during [Discovery]({{ site.baseurl }}/discovery/) and [Alpha]({{ site.baseurl }}/alpha/) stages.

If Alpha was the stage to work out what’s &ldquo;the right thing to build&rdquo;, Beta is the time to actually build it.

You’ll be continuing the delivery approach and ways of working that were established during Alpha. It is ok (and recommended) if you tweak how the team works based on what you’ve learnt about working together as a team.

The service you build in Beta will grow into the live service, so take the time to build in quality which will make updating and maintaining the future service simpler, clearer and faster. Don’t go overboard - you should prioritise your time on delivering MVP user stories instead of potential future user needs.

Your team will need to address the following:

*	Transition from a task-based backlog to a user-story-based backlog
*	Define and iterate a workflow that is reflected on the Kanban board, which includes definition of done (DoD) and other details that help the continuous flow of backlog items
*	Manage the MVP from a product management point of view for the rest of the project and beyond
*	The team should devote some time to story mapping all of the user stories for Beta stage (and beyond), this should the identification of larger Epics and Features level user stories
*	Your user stories should align with your roadmap for the release of your Beta MVP product and beyond that towards a Live stage
*	Have a workflow for continuous releases and unblock change management processes
*	Implement agile delivery practices
*	How you will recruit and test your releases with users
*	Have a plan for continuous improvement after the end of Beta
*	If working at the DTO hub, develop a plan for when moving back to the agency of origin

## 1.0.1. What Beta is not

Your Beta product is not the final product, it is only the first publicly released iteration of your chosen/defined MVP. 

*	It&rsquo;s not the end of your user research efforts - you must continue to test your beta product with real users to gather insights that will be fed back into the process. The insights will go towards continuous improvement.
*	Beta is not the end of the project - it&rsquo;s the continuation of your product development.
*	It&rsquo;s not a pretty or polished version of your Alpha prototype - it&rsquo;s the real thing built with the minimum amount of effort to realise the vision and benefits for the user.

Delivering an MVP with the minimum amount of effort will mean that compromises will have been made to get everything done on time. Although you might feel bad about delivering a product with technical debt, it is important to remember that you will continually improve the service during the live phase, giving you plenty of time to build the service to the best quality you are able.
