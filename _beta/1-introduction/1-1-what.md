What is Beta?

Beta is where you apply what you’ve learned by iteratively developing and showing your prototypes from Alpha, helping you select the best approach to turn your MVP into a working service.

It’s the third stage of DTO’s service design and delivery process, where you build a fully working service for real users. It will be continuously released into your development environment, and potentially integrated with existing components and services that were identified during Discovery and Alpha stages.

If Alpha was the stage to work out what’s “the right thing to build”, Beta is the time to actually build it.

You’ll be continuing the delivery approach and ways of working that were established during Alpha. It is ok (and recommended) if you tweak how the team works based on what you’ve learnt about working together as a team.

The service you build in Beta will grow into the live service, so take the time to build in quality which will make updating and maintaining the future service simpler, clearer and faster. Don’t go overboard - you should prioritise your time on delivering MVP user stories instead of potential future user needs.

Your team will need to address the following:
Transition from a task-based backlog to a user-story-based backlog
Define and iterate a workflow that is reflected on the Kanban board, which includes definition of done (DoD) and other details that help the continuous flow of backlog items
Manage the MVP from a product management point of view for the rest of the project and beyond
The team should devote some time to story mapping all of the user stories for Beta stage (and beyond), this should the identification of larger Epics and Features level user stories
Your user stories should align with your roadmap for the release of your Beta MVP product and beyond that towards a Live stage
Have a workflow for continuous releases and unblock change management processes
Implement agile delivery practices
How you will recruit and test your releases with users
Have a plan for continuous improvement after the end of Beta
If working at the DTO hub, develop a plan for when moving back to the agency of origin
