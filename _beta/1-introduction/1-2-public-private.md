title: 1.2. Private or public
section: 1-introduction

During Discovery and Alpha, you will have formed a vision for who your initial users are, and how they’ll interact with your service. You will need to decide early on in Beta how you can best make the prototype service available to your targeted users through a **public beta**. Before the public beta teams can try a **private beta** to test the MVP with real users in a more controlled environment, with the purpose of gathering feedback to iterate the MPV before making it public to a broader audience.

## 1.2.1. Private Beta

A private beta allows you to focus in on a select group of users who will help you test the service. There are several reasons why you might choose a private beta:

*	Your user research has identified that there are distinct clusters of users who have something in common, which you can initially target for the MVP. It might be their location or demographic information, or it might be based on their role or familiarity with your department.
*	You expect a large volume of interactions on your live service, and selecting a smaller number of users allows you to iterate faster with more direct engagement with users.
*	You might transition a selected number of users off the system being replaced and onto the MVP, allowing you to better help and support the user’s transition.

## 1.2.2. Public Beta

A public beta is made available to everyone and users can choose to use the prototype if they’re willing to try something new. Public betas typically have larger volumes of interactions than private, but the vast number of users can make it difficult to get consistent feedback from the same users throughout iterations. 

Private vs Public Beta 
There is no correct approach to take, as every service will have different circumstances. As a team you should be able to make an informed decision as to whether your service needs a private beta release before releasing your public beta.

This decision should be based on:

*	transaction volume,
*	inherent complexity,
*	risk to existing services,
*	infrastructure capacity.
