# Working with user stories

> &ldquo;Story mapping keeps us focused on users and their experience, and the result is a better conversation, and ultimately a better product.&rdquo; - Jeff Patton

You are now at the point where you’re going to &ldquo;build the thing&rdquo; but how will you manage the product? How will you know what to prioritise with your developers?

A user story map is a useful tool to established a shared understanding with the team. So that the whole team knows what needs to be built and tested with users.

The users stories you write help link features back to user needs. The narrative style of user stories mean that the whole team should understand what’s required without having technical knowledge.
