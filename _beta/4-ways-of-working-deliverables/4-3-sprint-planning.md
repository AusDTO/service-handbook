# Sprint planning

Just as in Alpha, your sprint planning sessions need to involve the whole team. Everyone should know what they will doing.

*	Aim to cover who they might pair with to deliver for the sprint.
*	Always cover recruitment of your test users. Confirm availability and plan for cancellations.

Refer back to your user story map to determine the priority of what you&rsquo;re delivering in the sprint.

## A new kanban

Your kanban wall will look different in Beta, since you&rsquo;re now working through a development workflow or pipeline.

Here’s a list of the swim lanes you’re likely to need in Beta:


| Icebox                 |
|------------------------|
| Backlog                |
| In analysis / design   |
| Ready for Development  |
| In Development         |
| Ready for review       |
| In review              |
| Ready for user testing |
| In user testing        |
| Done                   |

Ultimately, it&rsquo;s up to the team to decide which swim lanes they&rsquo;ll need and what they&rsquo;re named. Shared understanding is more important than specific naming conventions.

If you&rsquo;ve written tasks in your user story map, write them up as user stories and put them in the Icebox lane of your kanban board.

*	Work with your Product Manage to prioritise the stories that will be delivered.
*	As a team, decide on the Definition of Done for each swim lane. 
*	Keep sizing tasks to understand your velocity and flow.

Each story may have:

*	Acceptance criteria that you use to determine if the story can be moved into the next stage of delivery.
*	Design decisions
*	Developer notes
*	Administration tasks
