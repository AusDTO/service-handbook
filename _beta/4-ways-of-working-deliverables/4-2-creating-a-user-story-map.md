# Creating a user story map

Your user story map will start with a **product vision**. 

Your Product Manager will then work with the team to build the story map. 

A small story map will look something like the diagram shown. At the top of the map are activities. The activities are steps required to achieve a goal. Below the activities are the tasks that make up the activity.

*	Write out your story one activity at a time. Activities aggregate tasks directed at a common goal
*	Organise your story so that the tasks are stacked vertically from compulsory to optional
*	Explore alternative tasks (stories)
*	Prioritise the tasks. Don&rsquo;t Prioritize Features - Prioritize Outcomes.
*	Slice out the tasks that help you reach a specific outcome. 
*	Write the tasks as user stories and move them on to your kanban.

**Remember**: the stories are designed to trigger discussion with the team. They don&rsquo;t need to cover minute detail - it&rsquo;s the discussions that will cover the detail needed to deliver the product.
