## Team velocity

In Discovery and Alpha, the team have been sizing their tasks to understand how much work they can do in a sprint.

The **sprint velocity** metric is calculated by reviewing work the team successfully completed during previous sprints; for example, if the team completed 10 stories during a two-week sprint and each story was worth 3 story points, then the team&rsquo;s velocity is 30 story points per sprint.

In Beta, the team aims to achieve a fast and smooth flow of work. Everyone should know what they need to be doing after completing a task or delivering a user story. 

Being self-organised is key to having a smooth flow. You don&rsquo;t want your flow to be slowed down by having to wait for someone else to tell you what to do next.

Always ask yourself, &ldquo;Can I help finish work in progress?&rdquo;

Each sprint, evaluate your velocity and team capacity to meet that velocity. Be realistic about what you can deliver in a sprint so that you can maintain a good flow. You may need to re-prioritise your tasks / user stories to enable continuous delivery.
