title: "2.1. The team"
section: 2-getting-started

Like Alpha, Beta requires a cross-functional team of capable digital specialists, subject matter experts, and a strong service manager.

The team for Beta should build upon the team already established during the Discovery and Alpha phases. It is best if the existing team continue to work on the Beta - keeping the existing empathy, context and momentum within the team.

You&rsquo;ll have worked out during Alpha how effective your team is at delivering digital products, which will help you decide if you need to increase your delivery capacity. 

Don&rsquo;t be afraid to bring in additional help, but don&rsquo;t overdo it. Every new team member will need to go through the journey of understanding your user needs, which will take time away from actually building the Beta.

At a minimum, your team will probably need to expand to include a web operations expert who will ensure that your service is stable, healthy, and responds to demands when being used by real users. 

If your service is hosted in the DTO platform, evaluate if a transition to the home agency environment is needed and plan accordingly. **Engage your infrastructure team early**.

You will also need to think about the security of your service, so you will need to engage an ethical hacker to make sure that what you have built has been developed using best practise in security.

# Measure performance

Lastly, consider bringing in a performance analyst who will be able to set up and report on any analytics used for the service to measure uptake and metrics that might be used to understand user behaviour through the service. In addition, to meet the Digital Service Standard, gathering those metrics will help you report on the [Performance Dashboard](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/11-measure-performance/ "").
