Like Alpha, Beta requires a cross-functional team of capable digital specialists, subject matter experts, and a strong service manager.

The team for Beta should build upon the team already established during the Discovery and Alpha phases. It is best if the existing team continue to work on the Beta - keeping the existing empathy, context and momentum within the team.

You’ll have worked out during Alpha how effective your team is at delivering digital products, which will help you decide if you need to increase your delivery capacity. 
Don’t be afraid to bring in additional help, but don’t overdo it. Every new team member will need to go through the journey of understanding your user needs, which will take time away from actually building the Beta.
