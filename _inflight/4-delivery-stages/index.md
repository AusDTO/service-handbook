## Mobilisation & kick off

During the Mobilisation stage your agency will assign 3 assessors to the digital delivery team to cover:

*	design/research
*	delivery/agile
*	technology 

For assessments led by the DTO the Standard team will assign the assessors.

*   You should attend part of the team’s kick off to discuss:
*   your role
*   the digital delivery team’s expectations about meeting the Standard 
*   how the team will document progress against the criteria using the Standard Kanban board
*   when regular check-ins will be held (the DTO runs check-ins on Thursday mornings) and if you will attend in-person or via videoconference
*   which ceremonies you will attend regularly
*   the physical and digital tools the team will share with you to demonstrate progress, such as Trello boards, decision registers and agency reports.

## Discovery

During the Discovery stage you run the in-flight check-in during each sprint, in person or by videoconference. You will discuss the team’s activities, artefacts and evidence.

During Discovery the check-ins will be mainly focused on user research and what the team is learning. 

### Getting ready for Alpha

Once the team agrees they understand the user needs and can work as a proper multi-disciplinary team you can hold a discussion to work out if the service is ready to move into Alpha.

## Alpha and Beta

During Alpha and Beta stages you continue to run the team’s regular check-ins. Continue to document progress against the criteria using the in-flight check-in report. 

During each check-in use the recommendations made in the previous one. You don’t have to review each criterion each week, as long as you know the team is progressing actions to meet that criteria.

### Contribute to progress reports

**DTO assessors** provide the team’s RAG ratings to the [Digital Service Standard team](mailto:standard@digital.gov.au) by **12 noon each Friday**. The team collates the ratings into a full portfolio report. This report is not public.

### Moving to Beta

Once the service has green ratings against criteria 1-3 you can hold an [assessment review](/3-assessment-reviews/). You do this review before the service moves to Beta.

### Getting ready for public beta release

If the service maintains green ratings against all criteria and the team believes the service is ready to be released as a public beta you hold an [assessment review](/3-assessment-reviews/). 

### Getting ready to move to Live

Once the service is in public Beta you should keep running regular check-ins with the delivery team. You might agree to hold these less frequently if delivery is progressing well. At a minimum, check-ins should be at least monthly. 

Record any changes in reporting schedule in the in-flight check-in report. These will affect how the service data appears on the [Performance Dashboard](https://www.dto.gov.au/our-work/performance/).

If the service has maintained green ratings against all criteria, take-up of the service is on track and is working better than the current live service (if there is one) you can hold a final [assessment review](/3-assessment-reviews/). This is how the service progresses to Live.

## Live

When the service is live the digital delivery team will continue to regularly check it continues to meet users’ needs.

The service performance will continue to be reported on the Performance Dashboard.
