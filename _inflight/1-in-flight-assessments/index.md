In-flight assessment is a process of continuous improvement, mentoring and learning for the digital delivery team and the assessor team.

The assessor team runs regular check-ins with the service team throughout the process, not just before it moves to the next stage in the [service design and delivery process](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/service-design-and-delivery-process/). 

The check-ins are not focussed on passing or not passing services. They are about checking progress against the Standard. Assessors work in collaboration with digital delivery teams to build better services. Assessors help identify and manage risks and mentor the digital delivery team.

## Duties for in-flight assessors

As an assessor you:

*	attend [regular check-ins](#checkins) (in-line with delivery team’s sprint cycle) and provide expert impartial advice and guidance
*	spend time in the digital delivery team’s workspace watching their ceremonies and work practices - this helps you get a deeper understanding of how the team is working and what they're creating 
*	rate and comment on each of the Standard’s criteria red / amber / green (RAG) at each check-in and track the team’s progress on the [in-flight check-in report](/5-tools/) 
*	report the outcomes of the check-ins. In the DTO assessors contribute to the [progress report](/5-tools/) (DTO assessors only) - this is due to the Standard team by 12 noon each Friday. Agency assessing teams should also report within their agency.
*	take part in [assessment reviews](/3-assessment-reviews/)
*	[escalate problems](/3-assessment-reviews/#escalate), where required.

Your tasks change as the service progresses through each stage of the [service design and delivery process](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/service-design-and-delivery-process/).

Extra duties for lead assessors:

*	Set up, schedule and run the in-flight check-ins and assessment reviews
*	Lead the check-in and assessment review discussions
*	Ensure key points of the in-flight check-in discussions and any recommendations are documented and reported by all assessors at the end of each sprint
*	Write the stage assessment reports - Alpha , Beta and pre-Live
